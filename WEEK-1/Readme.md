Task-1 website : https://forge-build.vercel.app/
Task-3 Website : https://forge-build-i7iq.vercel.app/  { check out some instructions for using this task-3 website below }

Task-2 is in the DAY-4_5 itself
Task-3 only conatins output.

Disclaimer: to use task-3 website submit and get button do this :
1) you should have anvil chain running in your code editor ( for me it is vs code )
2) you should create a new network in metamusk with rpc and chain id of anvil because 
when we hit submit and get button it looks for anvil chain contract specifically as in my 
task-3 main.js i have create contract using anvil contract address .. 

please be careful while testing this for task-3 


Day-6 code will be uploaded soon , some work is going on 

ai integration around 15% in (day-2 media screen) and (day-6 ethers.js understanding) ...
